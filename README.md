DetectFace
==========

A simple OpenCV test

Instructions
------------

1. Install OpenCV (I used homebrew, but had to _brew tap homebrew/science_ first)
2. run _npm install_
3. run _npm start_
4. Go to localhost:5000 and upload an image (with a face). You can experiment with different cascades.

I found out that haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml yielded best results.
